Here Lies My First Attempt at my Portfolio.
I have positioned and aligned all elements accordingly
and created the buttons to the respective pages.
Changes are welcome. Please type your updates here so I can understand your process.

hey, this is charles[charleskasasira.github.io]

## Some of the changes i can think of.

i have created media, css, js folders to arrange the files just for me to navigate easily that made me change some of the path to images and the css file

i removed the js function, since you have the path to the index, you don't need the js file.

i added alt attribute on images just for best practise

removed the buttons because i felt like they were serving the same purpose as the links

about positioning, i gave the card(parent) absolute and the line to about(child) relative so as it follows the parent's guidelines

in the media queries, try to only specify what applies to the mobile only ie if it is the same background properties, it's okay not to mention them

try to avoid using px on font-size, personally, i prefer to use rem or em

will see if i can make some suggesions later, hope one or two things are helpful
